Project page: https://delftdata.github.io/repro-di/ 

The repository contains the [dataset](/datasets/dataset.csv) created by applying the reproducibility checklist on 27 papers belonging to data integration. The list of papers participating in the study can be found in the dataset, second parameter called _name_. We used the dataset to analyse the degree of reproducibility in data integration. The analysis can be found in the [jupyter notebook](Process data.ipynb).
